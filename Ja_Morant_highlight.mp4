Prompt: **SCENE START**

**INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - NIGHT**

SOMBER, REFLECTIVE. The arena lighting is muted, casting long shadows. A heavy, almost desolate mood pervades the scene.

A SLOW PUSH-IN on JA MORANT. He sits on the bench, hunched, shoulders heavy. His eyes are distant, reflecting the blurry, bright arena lights, not focusing on the game but on the weight of it. A bead of sweat slowly tracks down his temple.

CLOSE UP - Ja's hands, clenching and unclenching, showing a quiet struggle.

A fleeting, almost subliminal GLIMPSE of the scoreboard. The points against his team are visible but slightly out of focus, a distant, nagging reality.

WIDE SHOT - Ja on the court, isolated. He dribbles the ball slowly, almost absently. The vastness of the empty seats around him emphasizes his solitary struggle. The camera lingers.

CLOSE UP - His face again. A flicker of raw frustration crosses his features, quickly replaced by a forced, grim determination. The sounds of the game are muted, an echo in his mind.

The shot LINGERS on him, shoulders slightly slumped, lost in thought. The reflective pacing emphasizes the personal, internal battle amidst the grand scale of the arena.

**SCENE END**
Simulated generation for player: Ja Morant
